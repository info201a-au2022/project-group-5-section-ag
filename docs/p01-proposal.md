## The Dataset
## Expected Implications
  There is a certain level of implications we expect as researchers throughout this problem. We must note that this project isnt solving an explicit issue, it's for the benefit of the consumer of different streaming services. The largest implication this could create is that of the streaming service provider. This project will highlight some metrics that will force designers and technologists to take a second look at their respective service.   
## Limitations
  The greatest limitation in this project will be the lack of data. As diverse as our dataset is, there is certain metrics not included that would be interesting and insightful. Other limitations can include research bias from the originial researcher, but this will be addressed by us as we clean the data.
