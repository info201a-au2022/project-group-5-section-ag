## Abstract
Our main goal is to compare the large number of streaming services available to consumers to show the advantages and disadvantages of each one. We want to do this because of the increasingly concentrated streaming market and rising costs associated with accessing these services. We will reach this goal by manipulating the various data on the services such as ratings, costs, number of shows, etc… to come up with a score that ranks each service as well as allowing you to easily compare the various factors.
## Keywords
- Accessibility
- entertainment
- savings
- comparison

## Introduction
We are going to take existing data on the various streaming services on the market and create a data visualization that allows consumers to easily compare them and decide which is best for them. Users will be able to sort by factors such as ratings, price, number of shows ets… and put emphasis on the factors that are most important to them. We are also going to create an overall “score” of each service that tells you which one is most worth its price. With an increasing amount of available streaming services, this allows consumers to save money by cutting the services that are not worth the price and instead focusing on the services with the most value.
## Problem Domain
- **Project framing**: Our project is getting at comparing the different entertainment options on the market and helping consumers make informed buying decisions. This is not a massive problem with large implications but it will have interesting insights into something that directly impacts a lot of people.
- **Human values**: Like mentioned above this is not something that has a large effect on many people however it will get at the value of saving money. It also gets at the value of access to information because consumers will have a greater idea of what they are spending their money on.
- **Indirect stakeholder**: People indirectly affected by this data are the actual streaming companies. These are large companies that probably make money off of deceiving people so this data will help take power from the companies and give it to the people.
- **Direct Stakeholder**: The people directly using our data will be people using streaming services. It will directly impact them because they are going to be able to have better access to the data and therefore make more educated buying decisions.
Possible harms: There is not really any harm that could come out of this data. The only possible harm would be certain companies losing business but that would be because of their own doing and at the greater benefit of society.
- **Benefits**: as stated a couple times, the main benefits of this are just showing various aspects of different services and allowing people to easily compare them in order to decide which one is best for them.

## Research Questions
  * What streming service has the best overall value?
    -  Overall value means the most content for the best price and the type of content. Ex: Does the platform provide new movies, what genres, etc.
  * What is the similarity between streaming services?
    - This includes content type, pricing, advertisements and features.
  * What streaming services provide the best usability?
    - Which servcies are available on more than just desktop and TV? What is there interface like and is their platform cross compatible with other technologies?

## The Dataset
The dataset we choose is a breakdown of all movies and TV shows on four of the top entertainment streaming platforms (Hulu, Netflix, Disney +, and Prime Video). The movies have been ranked based on user reviews and critic reviews, allowing us to rank each platform's selection of movies and tv shows from multiple different standpoints (average movie/Tv show rating, average rating per platform, average tv show rating per platform, etc. Both the movie dataset and the tv dataset were created by the same person (name in citations). The dataset can be very useful and can be used to answer many different questions, most consumers who many choices have so these days on where to spend their money when it comes to entertainment and television. The source is credited and the rating for some has been verified to check for accuracy against what is shown.

## Expected Implications
  There is a certain level of implications we expect as researchers throughout this problem. We must note that this project isnt solving an explicit issue, it's for the benefit of the consumer of different streaming services. The largest implication this could create is that of the streaming service provider. This project will highlight some metrics that will force designers and technologists to take a second look at their respective service.   
## Limitations
  The greatest limitation in this project will be the lack of data. As diverse as our dataset is, there is certain metrics not included that would be interesting and insightful. Other limitations can include research bias from the originial researcher, but this will be addressed by us as we clean the data.
